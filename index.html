  <p><h1> Hello my name is Trey Higashiyama and I created the website you are seeing now. Let me tell you a little about myself, I have 2 hobbies that I love to do. One is Video Games they have been something that has always fascinated me when looking at how they are made and work. My last hobbie is basketball, on my free time I usually shoot hoops in my yard to just pass time when im not doing homework. The main reason why im taking software engineering because I the future I would like to college to stusy and work as one. In the future I feel that Technology will be a big part in our world so I wanna be apart of that. I would like to learn more about how to code and maybe one day create my own game or something. That is all thanks for vsiting my Website Enjoy! </h1></p>
